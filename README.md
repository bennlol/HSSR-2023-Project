# HSSR2023Tang
 
This is going the be a collection for all of my files from the HSSR program.
Structure of project will change

triplet loss might work better with the auto encoder because it will be able to generate different images and similar images easily

siamese network will be better with finding different images due to much more different image training because the random selected class is much more likly to be different than similar
